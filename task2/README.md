NumPy

1) Create a 1D numpy array of numbers from 1 to 10. What is the result of adding 5 to each element?
2) Create a 3x3 identity matrix using numpy?
3) Given the array arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]), how would you access the element in the second row and third column?
4) How can you reshape a 1D array of shape (12,) into a 3D array of shape (2, 2, 3)?
5) How can you create a new array that contains only the even numbers from the array arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])?

Pandas

1) Create a Dictionary with 10 key value pairs. Now convert this Dictionary to Dataframe using Pandas.
2) How can you drop the row with index 3 from the DataFrame df?
3) How do you rename the column "old_name" to "new_name"?
4) How do you change the data type of the column "salary" from int to float?
5) What method would you use to drop any rows that contain NaN values?
